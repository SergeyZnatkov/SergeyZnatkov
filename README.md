My name is Sergey Znatkov. I am a journalist based in Russia, currently studying at Tomsk State University. Despite my primary occupation, I also have an interest in coding, taking initial steps in that field now.

Currently, I have two projects:

1. «The irg-to-png-converter» is a Python script that converts thermal images into colorized versions using colormaps and then enhances the image resolution. This software solves the issue of saving data in a gibberish format
by modern heat vision devices. It has potential in construction, power engineering, and the oil industry.

2. Auto-start fork for Antizapret is an unofficial modification for «zapret-discord-youtube» by Fossil. The original repository allows bypassing deep packet inspection,
which is used by the Russian government for internet censorship. My modification easily integrates this tool into Windows and makes the application work invisibly. Of course, this tool is for legal use only.

My 2025 goals:

To win a startup grant and realize my business idea. I want to create a Telegram-based platform to simplify post-study activities: organizing parties, completing group work,
watching movies with group mates, etc. In this way, I can prove myself as a company leader and frontend developer.

End university and continue learning on my own.

I would like to visit Kaliningrad, the most western city in Russia, which is about 4,800 kilometers away from me.

Some facts:

I am 20 years old and have a couple publications in Tomsk media. My articles are usually about artists, cosplayers as an example, recycling, and city news. I am skilled in Adobe software:
Photoshop, Premiere, and InDesign. Every day, my schedule is different, with activities in the evening and midnight mostly. I have a nuclear physicist friend. We often craft things together,
from theater decorations to fire shows. In the near future, we want to do experiments with electrochemical anodizing by DIY appliances.
